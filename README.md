# AnimeCli

Welcome to the Anime CLI App! In this CLI application, you will be able to view a list of anime series, movies or mini-series that are accessed from the Jikan website (https://jikan.moe/). If you find an anime that interest you, you can see more details about it like it's title and rating!



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anime_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anime_cli

## Usage

To run the application, run 
./bin/anime_run

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
